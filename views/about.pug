            |My name is Elmer I'm a graphic designer, creating and designing is my passion. With 4 years of designing and 2 years in the field,
            | I'm trying to expand and branch out into new and uncharted territory with programming, Because you get to create apps,
            | websites, etc. from scratch which we'rent there before, and watching each project take shape out of every line of code that is written this is the type of creative freedom and innovation I strive for.
